Cesium [![Status Umbra][status-umbra]][andivionian-status-classifier]
======

Cesium is a fully managed C compiler for CLI platform (.NET).

**What?** Cesium compiles standard C source code to a .NET assembly. No unmanaged/mixed mode (a-l√° C++/CLI) code is expected to be generated; everything is fully managed (but unsafe).

**Why?** C programs are very useful in the modern world, and solve practical tasks. At the same time, deploying C code alongside .NET code may be tricky (especially if your application supports multiple platforms). Cesium is designed to resolve the problems of C code deployment, and lift it to the managed state (so it is crossplatform in the same way the underlying CIL code it is compiled to).

Implementation Status
---------------------

- [ ] C17 parser: _just started_
- [ ] CIL code generator: _just started_
- [ ] PDB support: _none_
- [ ] C preprocessor: _none_
- [ ] .NET SDK: _none_
- [ ] Standard library: _none_

Usage
-----

```console
$ dotnet run --project Cesium.Compiler -- <path to the input .c file> <path to the output assembly>
```

For example, this will generate an assembly executable by .NET Framework:

```console
$ dotnet run --project Cesium.Compiler -- Cesium.Samples/minimal.c out.exe
$ ./out.exe
```
