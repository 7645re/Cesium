Cesium [![Status Enfer][status-enfer]][andivionian-status-classifier]
======

Cesium is a fully managed C compiler for CLI platform (.NET).

**What?** Cesium compiles standard C source code to a .NET assembly. No unmanaged/mixed mode (a-l√° C++/CLI) code is generated; everything is fully managed (but may be unsafe).

**Why?** C programs are very useful in the modern world and solve practical tasks. At the same time, deploying C code alongside .NET code may be tricky (especially if your application supports multiple platforms). Cesium is designed to resolve the problems of C code deployment, and lift it to the managed state (so it is cross-platform in the same way as the underlying CIL code it is compiled to).

### Sneak Peek

Currently, Cesium is able to compile a "Hello, world" C17 example to a .NET assembly:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    puts("Hello, world!");
    return 42;
}
```

The next milestone is [#61: sha1collisiondetection][issue.next-milestone], which is **60%** complete _(note that the progress estimation is preliminary and may be changed in either direction at any moment)_.

Usage
-----

```console
$ dotnet run --project Cesium.Compiler -- <path to the input .c file> --out <path to the output assembly>
```

For example, this will generate an assembly executable by .NET 6, .NET Framework, or Mono:

```console
$ dotnet run --project Cesium.Compiler -- Cesium.Samples/minimal.c --out out.exe
$ dotnet ./out.exe # run with .NET 6
$ ./out.exe # only on Windows, run with .NET Framework
$ mono ./out.exe # run with Mono
```

### Optional Parameters

- `--framework <framework>`: specifies the target framework, defaults to `Net`
  - `NetFramework` for .NET Framework
  - `NetStandard` for .NET Standard
  - `Net` for .NET 5+
- `--modulekind <moduleKind>`: specifies the output module kind; by default, it is autodetected from the output file extension
  - `Dll`: gets detected from a `.dll` extension
  - `Console`: gets detected from an `.exe` extension
  - `Windows`: doesn't get detected, so it's only possible to select manually
  - `NetModule`: is a rudiment from Cecil, not supported

Implementation Status
---------------------

### TL;DR: is it ready for use?

Unfortunately, not yet. You won't be able to use Cesium for anything useful today. Probably, you'll be able to start after [the next milestone][issue.next-milestone] is implemented. Stay tuned!

### Dashboard

- [ ] [C17 standard compatibility][issue.c17-standard]: poor
  - [ ] [Preprocessor][issue.preprocessor]: about **10%** of all features are supported
  - [ ] [Lexer][issue.lexer]: mostly works, but needs more tests and validation on its compliance
  - [ ] [Parser][issue.parser]: supports about **25%** of the language syntax
- [ ] **Compiler**
  - [x] CIL code generator: basics are ready, new features get added
  - [ ] [PDB support][issue.pdb]: none
- [ ] [Standard library][stdlib]: a very few functions are supported
- [ ] [.NET SDK][issue.sdk]: none (but planned!)

Testing
-------

**Want to add new tests to Cesium?** Read a separate [document on tests][docs.tests].

There are two kinds of tests in Cesium: unit tests and integration tests.

Run the unit tests using this shell command:

```console
$ dotnet test
```

Run the integration tests using this shell command ([PowerShell][powershell] is required):

```console
$ pwsh -c ./Cesium.IntegrationTests/Run-Tests.ps1 -NoBuild
```

(don't pass `-NoBuild` if you want to automatically rebuild the compiler before running the integration tests)

If you debug integration tests and want to run just a single test, use this shell command:

```console
pwsh -c ./Cesium.IntegrationTests/Run-Tests.ps1 -TestCaseName quoted_include_fallback.c
```

where `quoted_include_fallback.c` is path within `Cesium.IntegrationTests` folder.

Publishing
----------

For producing standalone compiler executable run

```shell
dotnet publish Cesium.Compiler/Cesium.Compiler.csproj -r win-x64 --self-contained
```

Then navigate to `Cesium.Compiler\bin\Debug\net6.0\win-x64\publish\` and that's your Cesium.
